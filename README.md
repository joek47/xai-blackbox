### About
Security researchers have successfully applied deep learning
to classify malware. However, it is not easy to explain how deep neural
networks make certain predictions. This lack of transparency makes it
difficult to troubleshoot classification errors. 

By making the prediction process explainable, deep learning practitioners
can build reliable models for critical applications in cyber security. The
objective of this project is to explain deep learning malware detection.
